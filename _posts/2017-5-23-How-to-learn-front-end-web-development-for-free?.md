There are many ways that you can start learning about web development. Make what you are doing fun and all of a sudden, nothing seems so daunting anymore. Trust me, learning web development is a skill that takes time to hone. To make things even better, have one or two personal projects in mind that you can apply your newly learned skills like building a website from scratch after learning a bit of HTML and CSS! Slowly, apply some Javascript to make your website more interactive. In this article, I would like to introduce to you some of the free resources that I have used in the past. I constantly revisit these resources from time to time. Learning about web development is fun and exciting if you approach it in a manner that fits you best. So, I always recommend you to exhaust all resources possible to find the ones that fit you.

>Persistence is key!


**1. Start with freeCodeCamp (FCC) for free**

 There is a large community that you can join. Make the forum space and the chatroom on Gitter your classroom. Ask specific questions. It is almost always that someone there could help you out almost instantly based on my past experience. FCC has a structured syllabus which means that you won't feel lost and overwhelmed (at least that is how I feel compared to randomly searching YouTube videos figuring out how to create a button using HTML).

There are a few YouTube tutorials that might help you out sometimes if you are more of a visual learner like myself.

**2. Enroll in 'The Web Developer Bootcamp' on Udemy**

 This course is taught by Colt Steele and cost about $10 depending on the discount periods. Although it's not completely free, it almost cost the same for two cups of coffee which is quite reasonable in my opinion! I started with freeCodeCamp first but I felt that I always needed more than what is available on freeCodeCamp. Many of the freeCodeCampers recommended this Udemy course and so I decided to check it out. I am on the verge of completing the Advanced Algorithm section on FCC when I started the course. Although many might be tempted to skip through the basics once they learned it once or twice, but I am a fan of repetition especially when it comes to relearning the same things twice in a different way.

**3. Build your own static website with free hosting with GitHub pages**

 After about 3 months working on the mini projects on FCC and completing the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery while keeping up with my college assignments as an undergraduate, I started detouring a little looking for other ways I could reinforce what I have been learning in FCC. One idea that struck me was why not build my own website from scratch? Well, maybe you thought of Wordpress, Wix or Weebly when you think of starting a blog or website. At least that was what that crossed my mind at that time. That is when I found GitHub pages! You won't believe just how amazing GitHub Pages is. It is lightweight, reliable, highly customizable and free! Nothing beats hosting a static website on your own GitHub repository. You might need to learn a bit about Jekyll which supports the use of markdown for your blog contents. Another bonus is that GitHub Pages can be secured via HTTPS easily.

It won't be too difficult frankly. Keep learning progressively and then apply the knowledge which makes learning a little more fun and exciting!

In this list below, I have hand-picked my to-go resources to set up my first custom website that is almost professional-like. I am a fan of YouTube tutorials, reading documentations and online courses.

**Bonus:**  
Introducing Cloudflare!

You could improve your site performance by using Cloudflare.
Here is a good [read](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/). There are many features that are available via Cloudflare that you could take advantage of. You could set up page rules via Cloudflare to redirect non-www requests to www subdomains and you can enable automatic HTTPS Rewrites.


**A handy-dandy tip:**     
Make Google your best friend!

**My two cents:**  
Even if you feel stuck at times, don't make any of those moments your last try.
It is totally fine to just walk away when you are overwhelmed for a few hours or perhaps a few days.
